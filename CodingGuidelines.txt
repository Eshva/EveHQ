The EveHQSharp name-space is for main UI resources and code.
The EveHQSharp.Core name-space is to be used whenever access to shared resources (StaticData, save files, etc) or shared methods is required.
The EveHQSharp.EveApi name-space is used for whenever CREST or XML API calls is required. (no other name-spaces should require networking library's).
The EveHQSharp.SDEConverter name-space is mostly a standalone project and doesn't make an appearance in the main startup project.

This also needs more stuff.
